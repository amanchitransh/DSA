Project titled as Modelling a computer Network topology to support for Routers and CPEs 


Structure - Menu Driven
1. Press 1 to input the Details required regarding Routers and CPEs that are needed to be Connected with respective Router to design the Topology
2. Press 2 to Add a link with Weight/Cost between any two Routers
3. Press 3 to Delete the link between any two Routers.
4. Press 4 to Assign/change weights for links between routers/CPEs.
5. Press 5 to Find out and print the least cost path between any 2 given nodes(could be routers or CPEs).
6. Press 6 to print the Network Topology Modeled.
7. Press 7 to Add a CPE to a Router.
8. Press 8 to see the CPEs connected to a Router.
9. Press 9 to Delete a CPE connected to a Router.
10. Press 10 to Exit the Application.

This will be the basic structure that we will be try to follow and strategically If required we can modify the functions as per our requirements.
Also, If I miss something please add your inputs to this structure.
